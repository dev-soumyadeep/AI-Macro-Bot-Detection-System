#### [Pitchdeck](https://www.figma.com/deck/VqRgYvGJYW4P1Xv8rqokJR) | [Demo]()

## Overview

As AI technology rapidly evolves, AI agent-based services are increasing. However, while this progress brings many benefits, it also introduces new risks.
In particular, AI-driven macro bots are likely to be used illegally in gaming, trading, and on-chain transactions.
Our goal is to provide a solution that detects and defends against AI-based macro bots.
We develop an AI detection agent that analyzes on-chain data and AI agent transaction patterns to determine whether a transaction is executed by a macro bot.
This solution analyzes suspicious AI agent activity, verifies it, and records it on-chain to ensure reliability and transparency.

## Problem

- The rise of illegal AI-powered macro bots
- Increasing abnormal transactions in gaming, trading, and NFT markets using AI macros
- Difficulty in detecting and verifying AI agents in on-chain transactions
- Existing systems rely on simple transaction pattern analysis

## Solution

- Develop an AI detection system that identifies AI macro bots
- Analyze on-chain transaction patterns and AI agent behavior to detect suspicious activities
- Record detection results on-chain for verifiability and transparency
- Continuously improve AI detection models to refine macro pattern analysis

## Key Features

- **AI-Based On-Chain Transaction Pattern Analysis**
    - Distinguishes between AI macro bot transactions and normal transactions
    - Detects abnormal activities from automated trading bots, NFT sniping bots, and more
- **Verifiability of Detected Transactions**
    - Stores AI detection results on-chain for transparency
    - Uses Recall to log verifiable AI reasoning steps
- **Continuous Learning and Updates for AI Detection Models**
    - Learns new macro patterns to adapt to evolving threats
    - Maintains AI analysis models with up-to-date data
- **Real-Time Detection and Response**
    - AI detection agent analyzes transactions in real-time
    - Alerts and preventive measures for identified macro bot transactions
